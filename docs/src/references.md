## Credits
This package and the manual were strongly influenced by Hansen (2000). The image for the logo is a picture of Andrey Nikolayevich Tikhonov taken from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Nikolayevich_Tikhonov). The credit for introducing the regularized solution is shared with Twomey (1963).
