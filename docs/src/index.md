# RegularizationTools.jl

*A Julia package to perform generalized Tikhonov regularization.*

RegularizationTools.jl bundles a set routines to compute generalized Tikhonov regularization using standard linear algebra techniques.  


## Package Features

- Compute optimal regularization parameter using the  L-curve or using generalized cross validation.
- Supports zero, first, and second order regularization.
- Supports specifying an *a-priori* estimate of the solution. 

## Status

This package is under development.
